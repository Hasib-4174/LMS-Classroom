# Data Persistence (How Saving Works)

This project uses **CSV (Comma Separated Values)** files to save data. 
This ensures that when you close and reopen the program, your data (courses, assignments, etc.) is still there.

## The DataManager Class
The `data.DataManager` class is responsible for this.

### Loading Data
When the program starts, `DataManager` reads the CSV files line by line:
1. It opens the file (e.g., `courses.csv`).
2. It reads a line.
3. It splits the line by commas (`,`) to get the parts (e.g., Course Code, Name).
4. It creates a Java object (e.g., `new Course(...)`) using those parts.
5. It adds the object to a list in memory (e.g., `ArrayList<Course>`).

### Saving Data
When you add or remove something (like a new Assignment):
1. The program updates the list in memory.
2. It immediately calls a `save...()` method.
3. This method opens the CSV file in "write" mode (clearing it).
4. It loops through all objects in the list.
5. For each object, it creates a string with commas (e.g., `Name,Details`).
6. It writes that string to the file as a new line.

## File Formats

### users/login.csv
Format: `ID,Email,Password`
Example: `"2521228","student@test.com","pass123"`

### data/courses.csv
Format: `Code,Name,Instructor,Schedule`
Example: `CSE115,OOP,Dr. Smith,Mon 10am`

### data/assignments.csv
Format: `Name,Details`
Example: `Lab 5,Implement Inheritance`

### data/notices.csv
Format: `Title,Date,Content`
Example: `Midterm,2023-12-10,Midterm exam will be on Monday`

### data/enrollments.csv
Format: `StudentID,CourseCode`
Example: `2521228,CSE115`
This file links a student ID to a course code, representing an enrollment.
