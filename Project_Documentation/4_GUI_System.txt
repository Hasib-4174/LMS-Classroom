# GUI System (The Interface)

The Graphical User Interface (GUI) is built using **Java Swing**, but we used a custom "Framework" to make it simpler.

## UI Framework (gui.UI)
The `UI` class wraps complex Swing components into simple methods.
*   **`createPage(name)`**: Creates a blank panel.
*   **`createSplitPage(name, width)`**: Creates a dashboard layout (Left Menu + Right Content).
*   **`button(...)`**: Creates a styled button and adds it to a panel.
*   **`tableFull(...)`**: Creates a scrollable table with data.

## Main Window (gui.LMSGui)
This class extends `UI` and builds the specific screens for our LMS.

### CardLayout
We use a "CardLayout" (like a stack of cards) to switch screens.
*   **Login Page**: One card.
*   **Signup Page**: Another card.
*   **Dashboard**: The main card.

### Dashboard Structure
The Dashboard is a "Split Page":
*   **Left Side**: Contains navigation buttons (Profile, Courses, Assignments, Notices).
*   **Right Side**: This is another CardLayout! Changing the left menu button switches the card on the right side.

### Dynamic Updates
When you click a menu button (e.g., "Assignments"):
1.  The code clears the right panel (`removeAll()`).
2.  It asks `DataManager` for the latest list of assignments.
3.  It rebuilds the table with this data.
4.  If you are an Admin, it also adds the "Add" and "Delete" buttons.
5.  Finally, it refreshes the screen (`revalidate()`, `repaint()`).

This ensures that if an Admin adds an assignment, it immediately appears in the list.
