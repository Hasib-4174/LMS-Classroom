# User Model & Roles

The application supports two types of users: **Student** and **Admin**. This is achieved using **Inheritance**.

## Class Hierarchy
1.  **User (users.User)**:
    *   This is the *Parent* class (abstract concept).
    *   It holds common data: `name`, `email`, `password`.
    *   It has methods like `getName()`, `checkPassword()`.

2.  **Student (users.Student)**:
    *   Extends `User`.
    *   Has extra field: `studentId`.
    *   Has extra list: `enrolledCourses`.
    *   Has methods: `enrollCourse()`, `getEnrolledCourses()`.
    *   When a student logs in, the system loads their specific enrolled courses from `DataManager`.

3.  **Admin (users.Admin)**:
    *   Extends `User`.
    *   Distinguished mainly by checking `instanceof Admin`.
    *   Admins have special privileges in the GUI (they see "Add" and "Delete" buttons).

## Login Process
1.  User enters ID and Password in `LMSGui`.
2.  `UserDataManager` checks `login.csv`.
3.  If a match is found, it creates either a `Student` object or an `Admin` object.
    *   If the ID is "admin", it creates an `Admin`.
    *   Otherwise, it creates a `Student`.
4.  This object is returned to `LMSGui` as the `currentUser`.

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
In `LMSGui.java`, we check "Who is logged in?" to decide what to show.
Example:
```java
if (currentUser instanceof Admin) {
    // Show "Add Assignment" button
    // Show "Delete" button
} else {
    // Hide these buttons (Student mode)
}
```
This ensures Students cannot add or delete content, but Admins can.
